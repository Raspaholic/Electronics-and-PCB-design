Building blocks of analog electronics:
- Resistors: resist current low, drop volatages
- Capacitors: store electrical charge
- Inductors/Coils: Store/transfer electromagnetic energy
- Diodes: allow current to flow in one direction only
- Transistors: used as amplifiers and switches
- Batteries: source of electrical current/voltage generators
- Wires: used as conductors so electrical current and signals flow one
	electrical element to another

Through holes: go through holes on circuit boards
Surface mounts: go on surface of circuit boards
